## Harvard CS207 Guest Lecture Materials

These are the slides and notebooks for a guest lecture about Dask given to
[Harvard CS207](https://iacs-cs207.github.io/cs207-2016/) on 11/30/16.

Slides can be viewed [here](https://jcrist.github.io/harvard_cs207_talk/).

The `dask_array` and `dask_dataframe` notebooks should be runnable locally,
while the `dask_dataframe_cluster` notebook relies on some local data that
isn't public.
